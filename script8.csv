Leia

a 
secret

an

I've

which 
he 
inserts

POE

Turns

eyes. 
IT'S 
POE'S 
DROID! 
Rey 
talks 
to 
"BB-8, "
"who, "
nervous 
"now, "
looks 
around 
and... 
SEES 
FINN! 
BB-8 
STARTS 
BEEPING 
like 
crazy. 
Then 
something 
insane 
happens: 
REY 
LOOKS 
AT 
FINN. 
REY 
(To 
BB-8) 
Who? 
Him? 
Finn 
is 
confused. 
Rey 
"stands, "
staring 
at 
"Finn, "
defiant. 
Finn 
can 
feel 
trouble 
coming 
-- 
and 
Rey 
begins 
CHARGING 
AT 
"HIM, "
quarterstaff 
in 
hand. 
Realizing 
he's 
the 
"target, "
Finn 
begins 
to 
RUN 
-- 
away 
from 
"her, "
through 
the 
tent 
marketplace. 
Rey 
goes 
after 
him 
-- 
he 
turns 
a 
corner 
-- 
then 
another 
-- 
then 
BAM! 
She's 
got 
ahead 
of 
him 
and 
SLAMS 
HIM 
TO 
THE 
GROUND 
WITH 
HER 
STAFF! 
Finn 
is 
on 
his 
"back, "
out 
of 
breath 
and 
freaked 
out. 
She 
holds 
the 
staff 
on 
him 
threateningly: 
REY 
What's 
your 
"hurry, "
thief? 
FINN 
What--?! 
Thief? 
BB-8 
ROLLS 
UP 
"FAST, "
MOVES 
TO 
FINN 
-- 
a 
WELDING 
ARM 
TELESCOPES 
FROM 
HIS 
BODY 
AND 
SHOCKS 
FINN! 
FINN 
(CONT'D) 
OW! 
HEY! 
What?! 
REY 
The 
jacket! 
This 
droid 
says 
you 
stole 
it! 
FINN 
I've 
had 
a 
pretty 
messed 
up 
"day, "
alright?! 
So 
I'd 
appreciate 
it 
you 
stop 
accusing 
me 
-- 
OW!!! 
(BB-8 
has 
ZAPPED 
him 
again) 
STOP 
IT! 
REY 
Where'd 
you 
get 
it? 
It 
belongs 
to 
his 
master. 
Finn 
looks 
at 
her 
-- 
then 
the 
agitated 
"droid, "
Finn's 
mind 
racing. 
He 
puts 
it 
all 
together. 
"Frustrated, "
but 
sighs 
"heavily, "
needing 
to 
respond 
somehow. 
So 
he 
makes 
a 
hard 
decision: 
to 
tell 
the 
truth. 
FINN 
It 
belonged 
to 
Poe 
Dameron. 
That 
was 
his 
"name, "
right? 
Rey 
and 
BB-8 
"react, "
surprised 
and 
wanting 
more. 
FINN 
(CONT'D) 
He 
was 
captured... 
by 
the 
First 
Order! 
I 
helped 
him 
escape 
but 
our 
ship 
crashed. 
(reliving 
it) 
Poe 
didn't 
make 
it. 
(sees 
BB-8 
is 
"sad, "
rolls 
off) 
"Look, "
I 
tried 
to 
help 
him. 
I'm 
sorry... 
BB-8 
heads 
off 
to 
the 
"side, "
depressed. 
Rey 
watches 
"BB-8, "
then 
considers 
Finn 
again. 
"Says, "
a 
bit 
impressed: 
REY 
So 
you're 
with 
the 
Resistance? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Finn's 
mind 
races 
again. 
He 
makes 
an 
easy 
decision: 
to 
lie. 
FINN 
Obviously. 
Yes. 
I 
am. 
I'm 
with 
the 
"Resistance, "
yeah. 
(whispers) 
I'm 
with 
the 
Resistance. 
Rey 
lowers 
her 
"staff, "
Finn 
stands. 
Rey 
studies 
him: 
REY 
I've 
never 
met 
a 
Resistance 
fighter 
before. 
FINN 
"Well, "
this 
is 
what 
we 
look 
like. 
Some 
of 
us. 
Others 
look 
different. 
REY 
BB-8 
says 
he's 
on 
a 
secret 
"mission, "
he 
has 
to 
get 
back 
to 
your 
base. 
FINN 
Apparently 
he's 
carrying 
a 
map 
that 
leads 
to 
Luke 
"Skywalker, "
and 
everyone's 
after 
it. 
She 
turns 
to 
"him, "
"concerned, "
curious. 
And 
asks: 
REY 
Luke 
Skywalker? 
I 
thought 
he 
was 
a 
myth. 
Just 
then 
BB-8 
BEEPS 
MADLY 
at 
something 
he 
sees. 
REY 
(CONT'D) 
What 
is 
it? 
Rey 
moves 
to 
"him, "
peeks 
around 
a 
tent 
corner. 
Now 
Finn 
moves 
to 
see: 
at 
a 
"distance, "
